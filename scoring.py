"""
Scoring engine for SecurityAuditScripts executive summary reports.

Extracted from tools/exec_summary.py so that grade logic is unit-testable
in isolation without importing the full exec_summary module.

Usage:
    from scoring import compute_overall_score
    score, grade, note = compute_overall_score(pillar_stats_list)

    """
    Compute 0-100 security score, letter grade, and optional cap note.

    Deductions are per-pillar (not per-finding) to avoid inflating the penalty
    for regional auditors that emit one finding per AWS region:
      CRITICAL pillar: -8 pts
      HIGH pillar:     -3 pts
      MEDIUM pillar:   -1 pt
      LOW pillar:       0 pts  (minor issues; not penalised)

    With 20 pillars the worst-case deduction is 160 pts (score floors at 0).
    A typical first-time SMB assessment with 5-8 CRITICAL pillars scores 36-60.

    Returns (score, grade, grade_note) where grade_note is a string describing
    any hard-cap that was applied, or "" if no cap fired.
